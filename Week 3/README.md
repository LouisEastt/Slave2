# Week 3: Rules based Design, Drawing Machine Workshop & Pitch Introduction

## Summary <br />
This week Karen gave us the opportunity to avoid out flat screens and indulge into the real world. We examined a range of generative works that don’t use code.. employing a rules-based design system. Looking to defer agency. <br />

After seeing the potential of the shown case studies and the type of variables that can be played with… Karen sent us off to create our own drawing machines. Looking for variables of movement in our immediate surroundings.. (fans, bike wheels, car, skateboard, oven, vinyl player, water, wind.. etc). I tried to test out a few different ideas. My first idea was “Tramp Draw” which explored mark making with my small trampoline (attaching sharpies to the bottom), seemly only destroying the nibs of my pens.. NOTED. Secondly, I explored “Wheel Draw”, attaching a set of marker pens to the tyre. Attached so the wheel would still turn and not be disrupted. Moving the paper around, I tested a range of different locations before getting a consistent stream of mark making. Thirdly I explored the patterns that a lit candle would make, angled toward a cardboard surface. I thought that the consistency of a dripping candle would vary through iterations. Unfortunately, the candle burnt extremely quick and I think I needed to add in another variable to have interesting results. Next I tested a set of marker pens suspended onto a vinyl player.. not so successful. Lastly.. inspired by some of the students in our class, I rigged up my wood burner to be offset from my hand onto a piece of wood. Almost like the translate(){} function in processing. This created some interesting results with stationary moments leaving a deep burn similar to an ink bleed. Although.. my rig needed some improvements. This along with the generative case studies shown ignites some interesting questions. If we are the one creating this system, is it our work? or is it the work of the variables in control? Karen spoke of this as a human/nature collaboration, which seems to make sense. I wonder if there is a way where the artist could loose agency? If you give paper and a set of makers to a child.. is the work they create a collaboration with the one that offered them the tools? I guess when you take works such as “Tree Drawing” by Tim Knowles, he is facilitating the work, however couldn’t he be considered somewhat of a producer? Wow.. This is maybe too long. Note to self.  <br /> 

We finished the afternoon by trying to interpret some of the INPUTS & OUTPUTS that we had previously put together. Analysing some potential processes that could be used to translate the INPUT and create the OUTPUT. A fun and useful exercise in critical thinking and the odd combinations left us with some playful ideas.

## What could my project look like..(now)? <br />
I’m still currently quite interested in creating a generative system to create surfboards. At this stage I think I need to look into case studies that could be of assistance. Potentially generative architecture or generative furniture? I am unsure if I were to create these surfboards, should they be informed by any traditional structures of surfboards? Or.. should they be completely new and disregard any convention? Personally, I think it is important to recognise some design cues and it could potentially link my designs to existing surfboards. I could include design cues as parameters within my system to then be pushed and stretched. Do they need to be recognisable as surfboards? How “loose” do I want my system to be?
