# Week 1: Introduction to course
## Critial thinkers & a generative task

Summary:  <br />
All great things.. start with an introduction. What the F’ are we going to be doing? We begun with a definition of generative/ parametric design to try and position the studio. Before the studio began, I did some googling in search for definitions.. I started to realise that generative/parametric design is a highly debated practice. I found one article titled “Generative Design is Doomed to Fail”.. I’m sorry Mr Daniel Davis (author) but you need a lesson in optimistic thinking. Debate aside.. Karen introduced us to a diverse range of practitioners, understanding the potential of the field. My reaction was pure excitement.. at the endless possibilities and the intriguing selection of case studies.  Afterward, we moved into smaller virtual groups to design a generative drawing system. Our group bounced around a few concepts which lead us to designing a “Portrait Creator”. Allowing a set of parameters to control face shape, number of eyes, hair type, nose type and lip type. A simple exercise that was able to highlight the agency of the creator (us). Although it may seem that generative design is about something created from thin air.. we’re are in control. It is evident that some design systems are going to be “more” generative than others.. and we even started to highlight some of our bias in this exercise. 

Notable Works:  <br />
Now.. I’d like to keep note of the works that I connect with. Either for aesthetic reasons, conceptual or for the themes explored. The “Workout Computer” by Bless is a work that was particularly striking to me. The perfect amount of quirk for my liking. Looking at works from Bless, they describe themselves as that they ‘offer inventive connections between art and design, fashion and architecture, new definitions for objects and products and creative solutions in business and social practices.’ (http://freedmanfitzpatrick.com/exhibitions/bless-n65/). A merging of all things that I find myself interested in. Their work seems speculative and difficult to reference.. which could potentially speak to their originality. This may also be due to the fact their work is a merging of different design languages. Links to exhibitions where Bless are involved here (https://www.gta.arch.ethz.ch/exhibitions/retail-apocalypse) (http://freedmanfitzpatrick.com/exhibitions/bless-n65/) & (http://freedmanfitzpatrick.com/exhibitions/stefan-tcherepnin/). I wonder what generative furniture could look like? It could be interesting creating systems that do NOT consider functionality. Potentially this could look to re-design or re-think ways of using architecture? Ways that us silly humans may have not yet realised. I wonder if this is a dangerous rabbit hole.. construction during a pandemic? 

What could my project look like?  <br />
A REAL artefact (if possible)  <br />
Reactive (Experience based?)  <br />
Playful/ Quirky/ Stupid  <br />
Involved with Surfing  <br />
