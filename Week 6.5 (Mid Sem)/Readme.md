# Week (Mid Sem)
# Creating generative system & first models

## What could my project look like..(now)? <br />

“Break”..Kind of.. Sort of.. Not really.. I’m not complaining! <br />
I took this week to start to work through refining my potential generative system and to experiment with physical prototyping. I began by exporting the anchor point system that I had created.. and trying to observe how the bezier curves will be able to work into the system (with an element of randomness). This was the part I was really unsure of. Moving the forms into illustrator was able to guide me in gaining a better understanding. Noticing that the anchor control point would work if it was around the centre point of the two anchor points. Then I realised that I could have a separate random function that chooses the distance either side of this middle point. I’m sure this is making no sense..


Well… I had some luck there. Part of the discussion I was interested in with this work is exploring waste.. and using personal waste in the construction of the models. This was in reaction to surfboards being so mass produced and predominantly constructed from particularly harmful materials.. and often with no shame. Or a slight green wash.. “I only produce small amounts of high-quality surfboard… I’m always considering the environment”. Sure.. Either or, I was really excited to play around and experiment with constructing some of the forms I had generated. It was fun for around 15 minutes until I started to properly look at the models I had created… Wow. I need to re-assess. I’m not sure if I need each surfboard to be only using a single material..? Or potentially.. I use a waste material readily available to me which is easy to manipulate. Foam seems like a smart choice and is easy to pickup at any market. I cant push the desire to be working with my hands. As I created the models.. It was really difficult to be able to visualise the form that I had begun with, which may be more visible if I scaled up the models? Am I already becoming a slave to my own algorithm? Is a human & non-human collaboration rigid? If I loose this rigidity… and veer off the original form.. is this a collaboration now? More questions.. less answers.. I need to get back the drawing board. More experimenting.
