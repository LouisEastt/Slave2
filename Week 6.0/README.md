# Week 6 <br />
#Physical Data Works & Processing w/ Sound <br />

## Summary: <br />
This week we were not so blessed by the computer gods.. showing their almighty power with a stretch of technical difficulties. We continued on.. we are not slaves.. we are smart slaves. Karen walked us through a range of physical data driven works. Personally, these are the type of works that I like to engage in. I enjoy seeing the ways that technical tools can be manipulated to speak to design/art. During class.. we broke into groups to exchange feedback.. and tried to congregate ourselves into smaller clusters which were relative to our practice. Trying to find ways that we can share knowledge and expertise and learn collectively. A really smart way of working which encouraged collaboration and creates a shared space that feels less insular. An environment/practice that should be more embraced through RMIT. 

Later.. Andy walked us through paper prototyping. Showing us the power of quick production to map out the intricacies of a project. Particularly in relation to trying to understand how we may want our code to work or to mitigate potential problems. This workshop was re-creating a game.. my group choosing ‘Super smash bros’. The potential even through this workshop really spoke to how it’ll become useful. I’ve already realised that to be able to redevelop prototypes through this technique will be much more effective than working on the computer. Lastly.. we worked through processing and added ‘sound’ to our ever developing toolbelt. Processing never stops being fun, even will its challenges. It really is an environment that has so much potential. Although.. I’m sure that I’ll have my fair share of troubles with my own project..

##What could my project look like..(now)?
From our presentation last week.. I haven’t spent any time working directly on the creation of my project. Rather.. trying to nut out how I want the project to be developed. I’m struggling with understanding how abstracted I am happy with the surf crafts being.. How wacky do I allow? Re-thinking my approach.. I wonder if it is worth twisting conventional forms in abstract ways. Rather than creating completely abstracted crafts with no basis in surfboard forms. Honestly, I like the approach of both and I think I have to develop each idea. I have realised that I will need to start creating physical models before I have a finished system.. I think it could even potentially help in the design of the system.
