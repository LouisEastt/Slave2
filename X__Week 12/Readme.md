## Last Minute Revisions
After making some attempts to integrate some of the forms into my SURFBOR3D site, Karen mentioned that it could benefit from being able to visualise the forms. Her advice was to integrate the GIF that I had created which showed the generate systems along with some physical forms. I spent some time trying to get the GIF working, however I had my fare share of troubles and I had to come up with another solution for the short period of time. I decided that I could export a set of spreads from the book I had been developing and create a new sketch in the SURFBOR3D shell as “archive”. I enjoy that this is able to live as a seperate entity to the generator and allows for the archive to expand in content and appearance.

## Reflection

This studio has activated the creative opportunities that coding can facilitate, particularly being able to develop personalised tools and looking at coding as a gateway to communities external to design. It has strengthened a personal desire to work physically and create tangible artefacts, whilst realising the potential in works that have a relationship between the physical and digital space. I’ve realised new ways of working, shifting my thinking during the development stage which has offered a freedom through experimentation and play. Driving my personal practice through curiosity rather than a focus on outcomes.

From my SURFBOR3D project, I have become particularly interested in finding ways that generative design can used alongside other practices. The obvious “generative” ability always allows for surprising results and it’s empowering to be in control of how the system works. I strongly believe that we need to anticipate how digital systems will begin to shape us. I think there is potential in trying to find ways for humans to have more agency alongside these systems, especially in a physical space. Let’s take control,  we are the slave master. 
 
Given the current restrictions and my initial project aims, I’m pleased with how the project has eventuated. Whilst the project is heavily abstracted, I feel as though the analysis has some merit to be explored beyond a speculative project. Although likely discredited by traditional surfboard shapers, this may on its own be a reason to continue research? This work could be extended by continued research into different materiality as well as designing new craft systems. I am quite interested in seeing how other data could inform the design of the surf craft forms (weather data, personal surfing experiences, etc). For this project to be properly extended, the generated forms needed to be physically tested in the ocean. This is the most suitable next step as the insights of these forms in the ocean will inform the design of the next set of generative systems.
