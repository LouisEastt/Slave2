# Week 9

## Quick Progress Presentation, Pseudo Code and Processing Workshop

## Summary

Once again, we prepared and moved through a set of rapid-fire presentations for our milestone before submission. After three consecutive presentations it’s allowed us all to stay up to date and visualise the progress of each project. It seems as though we’re all trying to consolidate our research and understand what our final outcomes may be. Even through the weirdness of what online learning is, these presentations have forced us all to be able to quickly outline our research and present it clearly in our digital environment. All valuable skills and I think that it’s made for a worthwhile digital experience. 

## Workshop

This week we were introduced to split canvases, assessing their potential and how to set them up. This is definitely something I could see being useful for myself if I seek to develop my web surfboard generator. Allowing multiple canvases in one space which each have different variables. I can see this being used to create websites which induce a large amount of play and interaction.

## Personal Project

The past week I’ve continued to work through different translations of the craft forms, exploring an idea that Karen gave me last lesson to use existing books to showcase the designs. This was incredibly fun and allowed for several interesting results (the off-cuts and book interiors). Often the forms would overlap, reveal and juxtapose content.. although they never seemed to be performing isolated. Although, is that important? The project has underlying ideas which explore sustainability in surfing and re-using existing printed matter seems like a valid concept to showcase their forms. Potentially I could use books with less visual stimuli and hack the design to suit my needs? For example by re-contextualising the cues to the original book? (Front Cover, Title page, etc) Although I do think that recognising the past of the publication  does feel important.

## Feedback

* Looking at all the development as potential research..

  (Allowing to research all potential outcomes) 

**Michael Lam**
 * Maybe the carved books aren’t as far away from your project as you think?


## Current Questions for myself

* What is a suitable way of showcasing these designs?
* Within a showcase, should I show all research.. or simply the relevant research?
* What are other potential translations that I haven’t explored?
* Could I work through a personal visualisation that assesses the forms? 
* Narrated visualisation attempting to assess their performance?
* How should the models be photographed? (That properly reflects the project..?)

## Next Steps?

* Continue exploration into book mocking of existing books
* Continue to construct polystyrene models
* Evaluate suitable exploration of research/development (Publication)
* Explore alternative translations of craft forms?
* Web app potential.. is this something I should keep developing?
* Continuing to test 3D development? (Visualising forms infront of photographs)
