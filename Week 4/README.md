# Week 4
# Processing & Pitch refinement

## Summary

This week we continued to develop our skills in Processing.. focussing on importing image and type. It seems as though there are moment where I feel comfortable in Processing.. and then I have a mini fail and realise how little I know. It’s continually humbling and through problem solving to mitigate issues.. it can be extremely rewarding to get your code working. For some reason, I didn’t realise how easy it would be to import different typefaces and I’m starting to question what isn’t possible through Processing? 


What could my project look like..(now)? <br />

At this stage, I’m trying to understand what my aims in the future may be. Part of me wants these generative surfboard to exist as some peculiar artefact.. Then the other part of me is more concerned with how it could perform in the water. It could be beyond some playful exercise and I could design surfboards that could completely change my relationship to the ocean. In class, Sam did have an interesting observation… asking if surfboards are informed by the different conditions. He then went on to speculate what a surfboard could appear like if it were to be designed purely in relation to particularly conditions. Even designed on a day to day basis, then purified afterward to be recreated into something else. Thinking about how nature and the ocean could inform the designs could be an appropriate place for speculation?
