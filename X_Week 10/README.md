# Week 10

# A New Craft System, Web Development & Book Tests

## Developing on Polystyrene Forms

Continued construction of polystyrene models. Crafting an additional 15 models from the different systems.

## A New Craft System
Taking a step back and analysing the work in relation to the original project aims, I started to think about symmetry and asymmetry in surfboard design. It lead me to wanting to construct a symmetrical craft system that can fit amongst the systems already constructed.

## Exploring Book system
I’ve been trying to create a strong book system to accommodate for the different research/exploration. The book size that I’ve decided on is the pocket book through Lulu (108mm x 175mm), which I think is a suitable way of format for archiving. I’m thinking that the book chapters will be organised as a set of different questions that arise each component of research. It will allow to show the speculative nature of the research without appearing definitive. 

## Trying to develop a suitable web app for my generative systems
(That works on different screen sizes)

## Web App Development
### First Concept
My first iteration allowed the three systems that I had worked on to be analysed side by side. However I wasn’t sold on how the colours were interacting together. From there I thought that it could be nice to isolate each system once chosen (with arrows). 

### Second Concept
(Isolating each system)
This was a good second step. From here.. after a recommendation from Michael.. I started to use canvas resize to make the window more variable. Although I had a larger issue.. Each system I’ve constructed was not designed with the intent to be shown on web later. The web app wasn’t part of the plan. Each system works off an integer position that was created in relation to my initial processing sketch. If I were to do it again.. I would have made each position a variable dependant on the window dimensions. This concept is great.. although its terrible at smaller window sizes and you can start to reveal its flaws..

### Third Concept
(Working with what I’ve got)
To work around some of my earlier decisions, I decided to rotate each system and have is dependent on the centre of the window. This concept also integrates the new system that I created and compositionally this concept works quite nicely as it can allow for the use of each arrow.

## Some Feedback
### Andy Simionato
*	Publication as a suitable translation.. (A way of consoledating research)
*	Activate the potential of the reseach!
*	Design the shit out of it!
*	Bring it to design! (So that’s interesting for designers)
*	Make it so that you’re drawn in..
*	Consistency is key throughout all design outcomes. Think of it as curating a mini exhibition, a “translation”..

### Karen Ann Donncahie
*	What if you created a set of surfboards that were designed from surfing experiences? (Using previous surf data?)
*	What if there were images overlayed on top of the surf craft form? (Web App)
*	Could there be a save to svg function?
*	Potentially other links that lead to additional work? (This started to make me think of designing an archive to show the designs alongside. Potentially this could be scans of the book I create? Or.. Images of the research?)
*	Thinking about mouse pressed usability or touch so that it can be used on mobile?
*	Potentially using the device shaken function?

### Michael Lam
*	What if you had random google images in the background of the display? (Halftone edited)
*	Trying to resolve some of the subtle overlap of lines that occur when some anchor points are close in proximity..
