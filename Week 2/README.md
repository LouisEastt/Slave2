# Week 2: Instructional Design & Intro to Processing

##Summary:  <br />
This week’s class began with a few mentions of useful processing resources.. including “The Coding Train”. Then we started to delve into instructional design.. looking at artists such as Yoko Ono and Sol LeWitt. In relation to this studio, the works were relevant as they worked through a system.. which could potentially be created through coding. I think what I found interesting was that these works gave agency to the audience. Agency as well as involvement. It seems like an attitude of engagement and that I don’t often see in the art/design world. Karen went on to mention that these works were tapping into a “libraries” of the human brain. In some ways, these works would always produce the same result however they are somewhat generative in the fact that anyone to create one of these instructional works may produce a slightly different result. Due to human error or given how they interpret the information. I started to think that in many ways, memes are a type of instructional design. Particularly strong memes that have the ability for copy-fidelity. The meme in some ways is more generative than an instructional design work as it requires the audience to find a new way of appropriating the meme. Unless the one appropriating the meme wants to be lazy and copy the original idea. Just a thought.. Creating a generative system to create memes could be a fun and playful exercise? Karen then continued to show us works from a range of artists.. looking at the gain an understanding of the possibilities using a tool such as processing. 

Notable Works:  <br />
Yoko Ono “Snow Piece” (1963)  <br />
Raven Kwow “1194D”  <br />
Manfred Mohr “Artificiata II”  <br />

What could my project look like..(now)?  <br />
After the first week workshop.. I decided to make another generative system. I’ve been drawing odd wacky surfboard for a little while now and I thought it could be interesting to design a system to create them? I still need to find a way to make the overall shape parameters more generative. Surfboard design is incredibly traditional and exploring odd designs which would never otherwise be created is interesting to me. Not only because they are against convention.. I’m interested to see how they would perform on a wave? Could this find new ways of surfing a wave? I think there may be something here for me to explore.

Week 2 (12 hr Challenge) <br />
“You Wake up..” <br />
Trying to contort ones early movements of the day.. What if your first movements were to the inside of a cupboard? Maybe while you’re in there you need to stretch.. or perform a cartwheel? The next part is breakfast.. which has been designed specifically to create strange combinations.
