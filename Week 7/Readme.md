# Week 7
## Quick Progress Presentation, Pseudo Code and Processing Workshop

## Summary <br />
You know what.. I was about to write a summary of what happened today as I have in the past few weeks.. Will this ever be read.. is this useful..? I don’t know.. I’m likely just rambling. I’ll be quick, maybe it’ll be useful later. 

We gave a quick rundown of each of our projects.. accessing our learning, outcomes and current direction. A lovely way to see where everyone was at with their projects and also to ask some personal questions about my own direction. Re-assessing our paper prototypes.. learning about Pseudo code and finishing off with another fun processing workshop playing with type. I can see how Pseudocode could eliminate some early code issues that could be big time wasters if followed through with.. Even just as a good first stage plan! 


## (Daily) Pseudo Code <br />


```
“Showering” 
INT time; 
INT shower; 
BOOLEAN clean; 

IF (clean = FALSE){ 
	time since shower = TRUE> 5 hrs
	shower = TRUE
} 
ELSE IF (clean = TRUE){ 
	Shower = FALSE;
	} 

END IF 
```	

```
“Breathing” 
INT time; 
INT lastBreathTime; 
BOOLEAN breath; 
BOOLEAN nauseous; 

IF (breath = TRUE){
	lastBreathTime = time; 
IF (lastBreathTime > 60 seconds){ 
Breath = TRUE

IF (breath = FALSE){ 
	Breath = TRUE; 
}

END IF 
```


 


## Run down of Current Project <br />

Thus far I’ve been focussed on trying to create physical models from my generative system. Looking to find opportunities from different materials and how the forms can translate. Looking at different aesthetic features and potential scale translations. I’ve been developing two different systems and there a couple more that I could begin to develop (each working with different amount of anchor points and random anchor scope). My research has gone into testing with the generative systems and trying to find different ways to translate the forms 3 dimensionally. Looking back to the works that influenced this project and trying to re-examine the creators approach… (Truthful to materially and trying not to complicate my outcomes & thinking). My next biggest challenge is trying to find a definitive place with this project where they are developed. Seeing as they are not being created at scale to surf, what other outcomes would be a suitable translation? 
Finding a way to create them with restrictions? <br />
Translating in 3D space? <br />
Publication showcasing models and systems? <br />

I am trying to understand..  <br />
Is this project about <br />
..sustainability in surfing? <br />
..creating and evaluating frameworks for non-human & human collaboration? <br />


If the project is about their potential in the surf and I am not able to surf them.. what is the most suitable way for them to be translated?  <br />

* Should they be constructed as models..  <br />
* Should I create an archive of these forms?  <br />
* Select and construct the ones that I appear to see potential? <br />
		(A type of non-human/human collaboration?) <br />
