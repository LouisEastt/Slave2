#### A surfboard made out of water..? 
A fun speculative thought I had during the week.. thinking about Olfaur Elliason's ["Ice Watch"](https://olafureliasson.net/archive/artwork/WEK109190/ice-watch) (2014)) <br />
Surfing a carved piece of glacier ice seems incredibly appearling and I think it could have a really strong affect. As the "matter" of the SURFBOR3D would quite literally be water, it would speak to an array of different ideas. Similarly to "Ice Watch", it could speak to climate change and the effect that rising temperatures will have on the activity of the ocean. I don't think I can think of simpler surfing craft than a piece of ice, which would highlight surf craft potentials. To add.. it would be playful, intriguing and inviting. To add again to Elliason's "Ice Watch", it would be temporary. It would be a crafted surfboard with a finite lifespan.

Could a surfboard be carved from large pieces of ice? <br />
Potentially carving some sort of texture into the top layer to provide grip.. 
I crafted a mould out of Polystyrene.. Hoping that the form may be able to pop out..

## A surfboard designed from past surfing experiences?
This was an idea that Karen mentioned and I had to quickly test it out.. <br />

These images below are three seperate surfing experiences that I collected using a Rip Curl GPS watch (2015-2019). The constructed crafts have been created by outlining the space that I occupied during the surf. Karen had mentioned that potentially the experiences could be informed by four anchor points which link to the North, East, South and West position. After conducting some tests, I believe that translating past surfing experiences may need to incorporate more data to be a full fledged idea. This data could potentially be less related to how I occupied the space and rather by information relating to the speed achieved on the wave and wave duration. This could allow for more creative translations from the data as it does not relate to a mapping of space.

## Last Feedback
### Karen Ann Donnachie
*	Could the info section be re-click to return to systems?

Unfortunately I wasn't able to get the "INFO" section to work as a function. I tried to set it up as a boolean so that I could call it after to "INFO" zone has been clicked.. Although like many things with coding.. It doesn't work out exactly as expected. I did find a UI fix by covering the "INFO" section once clicked, and creating a note which informs the user to "Press and Arrow Key to Exit". A somewhat cheeky fix.. and it does the job? <br />


I'm still currently unsure how to integrate the physical translations that i’ve created into the SURFBOR3D structure. It potentially feels fitting that there are no visualised forms as it could allow an audience to imagine a more authentic “personal” rendition of how the could see the forms working. Although from the other perspective.. It may be difficult for many viewers to properly understand the potential of the project without seeing some of the translated forms..
