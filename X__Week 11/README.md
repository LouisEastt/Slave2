# Week 11

# The final push & last tests

## A surfboard designed from water?
#### A fun speculative thought I had this week.. 
Thinking about Olfaur Elliasons ["Ice Watch"](https://olafureliasson.net/archive/artwork/WEK109190/ice-watch) (2014)) <br />
Could a surfboard be carved from large pieces of ice? <br />
Craft a mould out of Polystyrene.. I had hoped that the form may be able to pop out..

## A surfboard designed from past surfing experiences?
This was an idea that Karen mentioned and I had to quickly test it out..
